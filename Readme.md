# Simple XR2VR
A lightweight (currently) Linux OpenXR motion capture utility that outputs via the [VMC Protocol](https://protocol.vmc.info/english).

## Usage
*WIP*

## Building
Run:
```
make build
```
Depends on `openxr` library to build.  
You don't need a runtime to build, only to run.  
If you run the project without the runtime running then the runtime will be launched (this will clutter up std out).  
  
Requires rust 1.80 and higher
